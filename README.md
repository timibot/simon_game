Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Simon Kid game! ðŸŽ®ðŸ§©  In this project, I've programmed a digital version of the classic memory game 'Simon' that's designed to be enjoyable and engaging for kids of all ages. The Simon Kid game challenges players' memory and concentration skills as they follow a sequence of colors and sounds.
